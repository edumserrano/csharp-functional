In addition it contains a description of all the analyzers and code fixes present in the repository.


apesar de falar de monads eu n percebo nd disto se quiserem saber mais investiguem . monads esta fora do scope desta documentacao.
uma das melhores definicoes de monad vem do guia de rx "insert quote". isto em conjunto com a serie de blog posts de eric lippert (inserir como link para os tips and resources) ajudou me a entender um pouco o conceito de monads.

all code examples are meant to illustrate the usage of the functional types included in <nugets list> and are not meant to reflect real world code practices

the code examples shown might not be applicable to all domains. This might work perfectly in one project and poorly in another.
