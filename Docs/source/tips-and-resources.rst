* Eric Lippert's series of articles on monads: https://ericlippert.com/category/monads. It's composed of thirteen articles and each one helped a lot to understand monads a bit better.

* Wes Dyer article on monads: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wesdyer/2008/01/10/the-marvels-of-monads. This article is mentioned on `Monads, part two <https://ericlippert.com/2013/02/25/monads-part-two/>`, the second article in the series and it contains one of the most succinct and easier to grasp definitions about a monad:
  
  * "Another way to look at these generic types (monads) is that they are “amplifiers”. An “amplifier” is something that increases the representational power of their “underlying” type."

* Another good and not mathematical definition of monad can be found at: http://www.introtorx.com/content/v1.0.10621.0/10_LeavingTheMonad.html. It says:

  * "For us, a monad is effectively a programming structure that represents computations. Generally a monadic structure allows you to chain together operators to produce a pipeline, just as we do with our extension methods. Monads are a kind of abstract data type constructor that encapsulate program logic instead of data in the domain model."
